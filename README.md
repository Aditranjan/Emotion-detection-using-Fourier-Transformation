# Emotion-detection-using-Fourier-Transformation
Aim of this project is to create a model which can efficiently detect emotion portrayed from images. Model is trained and tested on FER-2013 dataset (one of the most challenging dataset out there) which contains 28,709 train and 3,589 test images divided among seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)
